# GSAP Playground & Reference Vault

This repository is dedicated to practicing **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and serves as a personal library for reusable animation components in future projects.

## 🚀 Sections & Categories
- **Basic Tweens:** Practice with opacity, movement, scales, and basic easing.
- **ScrollTrigger:** Scroll-based animations, pinning, and parallax effects.
- **Text Animations:** Typography effects, split text, and reveal animations.
- **Micro-interactions:** Interactive buttons, hover effects, and custom cursors.

## 📂 Future Reference
This repo acts as a "Code Vault." When working on a professional project, I can navigate to the specific animation folder, review the logic, and implement the code snippet directly.
